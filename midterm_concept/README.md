Midterm concept proposal

I plan to create an interactive sketch to simulate the behavior of a water surface with a particle system.

When there is no external force, a rhythmic movement plays on loop.
With an external force applied, the particles move in the three dimensional space, 
the movement changes with correlation to the location of the external force and the neighboring particles.

Examples of the external force are: a ball dropped into the water; a boat sliding across the surface; a directional stroke in the water.
