Prototype 2 includes:
  sketch 1;
  sketch 3;
  sketch 4;
  
In Prototype 2 I:
  applied noise to the tentacles for a more nuanced behavior;
  created a seperate background activity in sketch 4--a group of glowing particles to mimic the behavior of algae;
  using sin waves and noise to modify the behavior of the Jellyfish's bell and make it move according to the jellyfish's thrusting motion;
  *attempted* to gather points on the bell as anchors from which to grow the tentacles
  *attempted* to use an array of ofPoints to trace the trail of the Jellyfish, in order to create an "oral arm" and an abstract fin around the core polyline
