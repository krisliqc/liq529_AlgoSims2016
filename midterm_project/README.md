Midterm project concept:

I created an interactive sketch to simulate the behavior of a water surface responding to external forces.
Within the sketch, the water surface is represented by two systems: a particle system and a oscillating ripple effect.

A mouse click action would trigger the animation. With an external force applied (a click), the particle system move in the three dimensional space according to a trigonometric function and in relationship to the position of the mouse, 
also a ripple effect is generated from the same position, which would eventually disappear after the ripple has grown in scale.
Two boats would seek that position as a destination alternately.

The position of viewing is deliberately set at the best viewing angle to perceive the 3-dimensional oscillating effect.
The background has a warm color drop, created by placing an translucent image, in order to mimic the sky.
