This is an interactive script, responding to the movement of the mouse.

I created a class called Xtring, for strings which include particles and springs. 
These "Xtrings" will follow the mouse; there are two spots (100,400) and (700,100) that the particles in the strings will avoid, causing a disturbance to the overall movement.

If you hold the mouse over the centerpoint of the gathering strings, you'll see them forming into a circular shape.
